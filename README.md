# satel-ethm
Perl driver for Satel Integra security system with ETHM module. Allows to integrate with ethernet.
Unlike other inegration modules it uses reversed AES encryped internal Satel protocol used by DLOADX tool, so it has more functions.

Work is partially based on:
* http://www.elektroda.pl/rtvforum/topic1102459.html and mentionedthere PDF's
* java code of acc.ethm1.ETHM1Proxy which has no credits and is not published currently anywhere
